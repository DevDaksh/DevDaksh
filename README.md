### Daksh Kulshrestha

Hey, this is Daksh :)
<br>
I am a student currently aspiring over becoming a web engineer. I have a good grasp of Python, Javascript & CSS (I write my own media queries so, I guess you get an idea.)
<br>
I work as a web developer. My main technology of use is ReactJS for frontend. I love to work on challenging projects. If anyone is down for collaborating then let's connect!
<br>
A few of my hobbies apart from tech industry includes music production, cricket and playing games!
